# NFT Management
# Overview
This JavaScript script demonstrates a simple NFT (Non-Fungible Token) minting and management system. The script allows for the creation, listing, and counting of NFTs, each represented by an object containing metadata.

# Features
Mint NFTs: Create an NFT object with specific metadata and store it in a list.
List NFTs: Print the metadata of all minted NFTs to the console.
Get Total Supply: Return and print the total number of minted NFTs.

# Variable to Hold NFTs
A variable named NFTs is created to hold an array of NFT objects.
# Mint Function
The mintNFT function takes three parameters (name, id, salary), creates an NFT object using these parameters for its metadata, and stores it in the NFTs array.
# List NFTs Function
The listNFTs function iterates through the NFTs array and prints the metadata of each NFT to the console.
# Get Total Supply Function
The getTotalSupply function prints the total number of minted NFTs to the console.
# Usage
Below the function definitions, the script calls the mintNFT function three times to create three NFTs. Then, it calls listNFTs to print their metadata and getTotalSupply to print the total number of NFTs.
