NFT Management System:
This JavaScript program is a simple implementation of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) management system. It allows users to mint NFTs representing employees and view them.

Assessment Requirements:
Variable for NFTs: Created a variable NFTs to hold NFTs. It's an array that can store multiple NFT objects.
mintNFT Function: Defined a function mintNFT to create NFT objects. The function takes parameters for metadata (name, id, salary) and stores the created NFT in the NFTs array.
listNFTs Function: Created a function listNFTs to print metadata of all NFTs stored in the NFTs array to the console.
getTotalSupply Function: Implemented a function getTotalSupply to return the total number of NFTs created.
Usage
Call mintNFT function to create NFTs. Pass employee details (name, id, salary) as parameters.
Use listNFTs function to print all NFT metadata.
Invoke getTotalSupply function to get the total number of NFTs minted.
Note:
Make sure to include the script in an HTML file or run it using a JavaScript runtime environment to see the output.
